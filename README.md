## Getting Started

### Preparing the local environment

For running this program locally, please:

-   [Install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git/)
-   [Install Ruby 3.0](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
-   [Install node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
-   [Install `yarn` globally](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-packages-globally/)
-   [Install GraphicsMagic](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/README.html/)

> Note: as discussed below, downloading the source code without `git` is possible.

Once git is installed, get a copy of this project by one of the following methods:

-   By cloning the repository using `git`
    -   `git clone git@github.com:NoTengoBattery/rails-lifestyles.git`
-   By downloading a zip with the source code
    -   Click [here](https://github.com/NoTengoBattery/rails-lifestyles/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to download a copy of the stable branch
    -   Extract it in a place with easy access to a terminal

When Ruby 3.0, GraphicsMagic and Node.js are installed, and you have a copy of the source code, open the terminal and navigate to the folder where the code is. If you need help navigating using the terminal, please check the following articles:

-   For Windows users, check [this](https://www.technoloxy.com/tutorials/cmd-navigate-view-run/) article.
-   For UNIX/UNIX-like users such as Linux and macOS users, check [this](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-filedir/index.html) article.

> Note: the following commands should be executed in the project's root directory.

Install the dependencies by running `bundle install`. There may be need for providing the administrator password. For more information about Ruby's `bundle` tool, please check [here](https://bundler.io/man/bundle-install.1.html).

Prepare the working environment by running the following command: `bundle exec bin/setup`. That command will automatically set up the development environment and finish the installation of the Node.js dependencies.

### Running

After following the instructions for getting started, execute `bundle exec rails server` for running this project. This will start the Rails server. Visit the local demo at <http://localhost:3000> (by default).

#### Running the tests

Running the tests is similar to running the server. For this, `bundle` is **required**. Run the test suite by issuing the following command: `bundle exec rspec`.
