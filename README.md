## Getting Started

### Preparing the local environment
For running this program locally, you need to:
- [Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
- [Install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

> Note: as discussed below, downloading the source code without `git` is possible.

Once Ruby is installed, get a copy of this project by:
- Cloning the repository using `git`
  * `git clone git@github.com:NoTengoBattery/rails-lifestyles.git`
- Downloading a zip with the source code
  * Click [here](https://github.com/NoTengoBattery/rails-lifestyles/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to download a copy of the stable branch
  * Click [here](https://github.com/NoTengoBattery/rails-lifestyles/archive/refs/heads/development.zip) to download a copy of the development branch
  * Once  downloaded, extract it in a place with easy access to a terminal

Once Ruby is installed, and you have a copy of the source code, open the terminal and navigate to the folder where the code is:
- For Windows users, check [this](https://www.technoloxy.com/tutorials/cmd-navigate-view-run/) article.
- For UNIX/UNIX-like users such as Linux and macOS users, check [this](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-filedir/index.html) article.

Install the Gems by running `bundle install`. You may need to provide your user password. For more information about Ruby's `bundle`, check [here](https://bundler.io/man/bundle-install.1.html).

Prepare the working environment by running the following command (this command does not work if you didn't install the gems as stated above): `bundle exec bin/setup`.

### Running
After following the instructions for getting started, you can execute `bundle exec rails server` for running this project. This will start the Rails server. You can visit the local demo at http://localhost:3000 (by default unless you changed the configuration).
